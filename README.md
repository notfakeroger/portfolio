# Thank you very much for the access!

I'm Gustavo Roger, a junior front-end web developer. I'm studying to become a web developer and I made that website to show my knowledge about web developing. I am looking for my first job, so I am inexperienced. Hope that project help me to find a job or an internship.

I made other projects like a calculator using JavaScript and a Login Screen page using HTML and CSS. They're here on my Github profile. I would appreciate it if you would check these projects out.

Have a great week and thank you again for your attention! 

=)
