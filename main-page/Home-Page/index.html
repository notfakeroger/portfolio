                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Gustavo Roger de Oliveira de Veiga</strong>. I was born in Brazil and I'm 19 years old.
                I always had in touch with computers and technologies. Since I finished high school, I was sure that I would work with computers and internet. While I was in Brazil, I completed two semesters of <strong>Analysis and Systems Development</strong> in a College (Faculdade Anhanguera de Sorocaba) and I learned about Python, C/C++, SQL (not the codes, just the way to model), algorithm, programming logic etc. Despite I was learning about Software development and Back-end content at College, I liked to study by myself about Front-end. So, I studied <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> on Youtube and I made a project of a *Login Screen, that can be seen on my Github page.
                I studied English at a institution called Kumon until I got the opportunity to study in Canada.
                My objective is to become a <strong>Front-end Web Developer</strong> because I really like to code using <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. I'm searching for a internship or Junior job that I could be teached by someone who has a real experience of Front-end development, then I would become a better profissional.</p>
